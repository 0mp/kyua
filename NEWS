Changes in version 0.2
======================

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED YET.


Changes in version 0.1
======================

Experimental version released on June 23rd, 2011.

This is the first public release of the kyua-cli package.

The scope of this release is to provide functional replacement for the
'atf-run' utility included in the atf package.  At this point, 'kyua'
can reliably run the NetBSD 5.99.53 test suite delivering the same
results as 'atf-run'.

The reporting facilities of this release are quite limited.  There is
no replacement for 'atf-report' yet, and there is no easy way of
debugging failing test programs other than running them by hand.  These
features will mark future milestones and therefore be part of other
releases.

Be aware that this release has suffered very limited field testing.
The test suite for kyua-cli is quite comprehensive, but some bugs may
be left in any place.
