-- \file engine/user_files/init.lua
-- Code to initialize the processing of a specific Kyua configuration file.
--
-- A Kyua configuration file has always the following structure:
--
-- ---- cut here ----
-- syntax("<format>", <version>)
--
-- ... anything else as defined by the specific format-version ...
-- ---- cut here ----
--
-- In order to process a file like the above, the caller must follow the
-- protocol described in the run() function.
--
-- TODO(jmmv): Ideally, this module would be written completely in C++.  This
-- would allow us to avoid importing *any* global modules by default (the ones
-- required for the code below to work).  Required modules (such as table, fs,
-- etc.) would be imported by syntax() depending on the appropriate format.


local P = {}

-- table, A copy of the pristine global environment (as it was on entry).
--
-- At this point, the environment contains only those keys defined on entry:
-- i.e. the entities imported into the global namespace by the host application.
--
-- We must store a copy of the global environment state at this point before we
-- add new entries to it, so that when we chainload another file, we can set up
-- a completely clean state for it.
local ENV = {}
do
   for key, value in pairs(_G) do
      ENV[key] = value
   end
