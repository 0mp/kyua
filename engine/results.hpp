/// \file engine/results.hpp
/// Representation and parsing of test case results.
///
/// This module provides a set of classes to represent all the possible results
/// of a test case.  These results are represented as different classes because
/// each result may contain a different subset of valid fields (e.g. an optional
/// integer argument or an optional reason).  The overall approach is quite
/// complex but ensures that every result only contains fields it requires, and
/// thus proper validation can be performed at compilation time.
///
/// Note that test cases that generate an invalid test result are considered to
/// be broken (e.g. they do not conform to what we expect here or the test
/// program monitor code is broken).  Therefore, the specific result provided by
/// them (if any) is discarded and is transformed into a results::broken result.
///
/// Users of this module need to downcast results::base_result instances to
/// their specific types for further processing.

/// \todo I think special-casing the "passed" type to not expose a reason is a
/// lot of hassle.  Maybe we should just optionally-return a result regardless
