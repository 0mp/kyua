Introduction
============

Kyua is a testing framework for both developers and users.  Kyua differs
from other testing frameworks in that it implements a generic runtime
and reporting engine that is able to execute test programs regardless of
the language they are implemented in or the unit-testing libraries that
they use.  Additionally, Kyua puts the user experience before anything
else by allowing end users (not only developers) to run the tests
themselves.


Modules
=======

This directory contains the top-level source tree of the Kyua project
and holds the collection of all modules that form Kyua.

The following is a brief description of the modules you will find here
sorted by reverse dependency order:

* kyua-testers: Scriptable interfaces to interact with test programs
  of various kinds.

* kyua-cli: Runtime and reporting engine, including the command-line
  interface to Kyua.

* kyua-atf-compat: Utilities to ease the transition from ATF to Kyua.

Each module is released and published separately and, for that reason,
you will find self-contained configure and Makefile scripts within each
of the subdirectories.
