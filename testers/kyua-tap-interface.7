.Nm "kyua tap-interface"
.Nd Description of the TAP test program interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Em Test Anything Protocol
is a simple text-based protocol that allows the communication of a test
program with a test engine as part of the test's
.Em execution .
More details on the protocol can be found here:

.Ed
.Pp
A TAP-compliant test program has one or more test cases, although
unfortunately it is not possible to query what these are without actually
running the tests.  The practical implication of this is that Kyua will
treat all bundled tests as a single unit.
.Pp
The results of a TAP test program are one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width passedXX
.It passed
If all test cases within the program report
.Sq ok .
.It failed
If all test cases within the program report
.Sq not ok .
.It broken
If the output of the test program is not well-formed according to the TAP
specification, or if the test program crashes or times out.
.El
.Ss Configuration varibles
The test engine may pass run-time configuration variables to the test program
via the environment.  The name of the configuration variable is prefixed with
.Sq TEST_ENV_
so that a configuration variable of the form
.Sq foo=bar
becomes accessible in the environment as
.Sq TEST_ENV_foo=bar .
.Ss Isolation
TAP-compliant test programs are executed with the same isolation features as
ATF test programs; see
.Xr kyua-atf-interface 7 .
