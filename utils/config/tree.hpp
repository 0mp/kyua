/// The string keys of the tree are in dotted notation and actually represent
/// path traversals through the nodes.
///
/// Our trees are "strictly-keyed": keys must be defined as "existent" before
/// their values can be set.  Defining a key is a separate action from setting
/// its value.  The rationale is that we want to be able to control what keys
/// get defined: because trees are used to hold configuration, we want to catch
/// typos as early as possible.  Also, users cannot set keys unless the types
/// are known in advance because our leaf nodes are strictly typed.
///
/// However, there is an exception to the strict keys: the inner nodes of the
/// tree can be static or dynamic.  Static inner nodes have a known subset of
/// children and attempting to set keys not previously defined will result in an
/// error.  Dynamic inner nodes do not have a predefined set of keys and can be
/// used to accept arbitrary user input.
///
/// For simplicity reasons, we force the root of the tree to be a static inner
/// node.  In other words, the root can never contain a value by itself and this
/// is not a problem because the root is not addressable by the key space.
/// Additionally, the root is strict so all of its direct children must be
/// explicitly defined.
///
/// This is, effectively, a simple wrapper around the node representing the
/// root.  Having a separate class aids in clearly representing the concept of a
/// tree and all of its public methods.  Also, the tree accepts dotted notations
/// for the keys while the internal structures do not.
