Kyua is a testing framework for both developers and users.  Kyua differs
from other testing frameworks in that it implements a generic runtime
and reporting engine that is able to execute test programs regardless of
the language they are implemented in or the unit-testing libraries that
they use.  Additionally, Kyua puts the user experience before anything
else by allowing end users (not only developers) to run the tests
themselves.

This module, kyua-atf-compat, provides tools to ease the transition from
ATF to Kyua.  In particular, this includes a tool to convert Atffile
files to Kyuafile files in an automated manner, and drop-in replacement
wrappers for both atf-run and atf-report.
