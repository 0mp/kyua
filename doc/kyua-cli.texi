@top The Kyua testing framework

Kyua (pronounced Q.A.) is a testing framework focused both on
developers and on users.  Kyua is composed of several different
components among which are a command-line tool for interaction with
the runtime engine and a collection of libraries to aid in the
development of test cases.

This manual describes the operation of the command-line interface to
the Kyua testing framework and corresponds to the kyua-cli package,
version @value{VERSION}.
