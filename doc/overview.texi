@cindex overview

Kyua (pronounced Q.A.) is a testing framework for both developers and
users.  Kyua is different from most other testing frameworks in that
it puts the end user experience before anything else.  There are
multiple reasons for users to run the tests themselves, and Kyua
ensures that they can do so in the most convenient way.

At the moment, Kyua is focused on implemented a solid foundation and a
powerful command-line tool to run tests implemented with the Automated
Testing Framework (ATF).  Later on, Kyua will also provide a set of
language bindings (C, C++ and shell, at the least) to ease the
implementation of test cases in a variety of programming
languages.

In effect, Kyua is intended to be a replacement for ATF.  The code
base of ATF is very hard to extend and the overall design of the tools
make it impossible to implement some features highly desired by users
-- e.g. parallel execution or historical test results data.
Additionally, the entry barrier for contributions to ATF is too high:
the whole project hosting for ATF uses tools that are not widespread
enough and that run on personal slow servers.  Kyua, at least for now,
uses popular solutions such as Subversion and hosting at Google Code
which should allow casual users and developers to contribute to the
project more easily.
