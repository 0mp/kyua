.Sh NAME
.Nm results-files
.Nd Description of the results files naming scheme
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the execution of a
test suite.  Each test suite executed by
.Xr kyua-test 1
generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later on by
inspection commands such as
.Xr kyua-report 1
to analyze their contents.
.Pp
Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name lookups.  The
differences between the two are described below.
.Ss Values accepted by --results-file
Every command in Kyua that creates or reads from a results file accepts a
.Fl -results-file
flag to indicate which file to be used.
.Pp
For commands that
.Em create a results file
(only
.Xr 1 kyua-test
at the moment), the following values are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Sq NEW
Requests the automatic generation of a new results file name based on the test
suite being run and the current time.
.It Explicit file name (aka everything else)
Store the results file where indicated.
.El
.Pp
For commands that
.Em read from an existing results file
(notably
.Xr kyua-report 1 ) ,
the following values are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Sq LATEST
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted
at the current directory.
.It Directory
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted
at the given directory.
.It Test suite name
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the given test suite.
.It Results identifier
Requests the load of a specific results file.
.It Explicit file name (aka everything else)
Load the specified results file.
.El
.Pp
.Ss Naming scheme
The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support for
identifier-based lookups and historical recording of test suite runs.  Each
results file is given an identifier derived from the test suite that generated
it and the time the test suite was run.  Kyua can later look up results files by
these fileds.
.Pp
The identifier follows this pattern:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(Lttest_suite\*(Gt.\*(LtYYYYMMDD\*(Gt-\*(LtHHMMSS\*(Gt-\*(Ltuuuuuu\*(Gt
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Sq test_suite
is the path to the root of the test suite that was run with all slashes replaced
by underscores and
.Sq YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu
is a timestamp with microsecond resolution.
.Pp
When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in the
.Pa ~/.kyua/results/
subdirectory and each file holds a name of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.kyua/results/kyua.\*(Ltidentifier\*(Gt.db
.Ed
.Pp
.Ss Internals
Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in the
.Pa __STOREDIR__/schema_v?.sql
files.  For details on the schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL
file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Pa ~/.kyua/results/
Default location for the results files.
.It Pa __STOREDIR__/schema_v?.sql
SQL schema to apply to new results files.
.El
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
Let's say you run the following command twice in a row:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kyua test -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile
.Ed
.Pp
The two executions will generate two files with names like these:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.kyua/results/kyua.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
~/.kyua/results/kyua.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db
.Ed
.Pp
Taking advantage of the default naming scheme, the following commands would all
generate a report for the results of the
.Em latest
execution of the test suite:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/tests && kyua report
cd /usr/tests && kyua report --results-file=LATEST
kyua report --results-file=/usr/tests
kyua report --results-file=usr_tests
kyua report --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451
.Ed
.Pp
But it is also possible to explicitly load data for older runs or from
explicitly-named files:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kyua report --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784
kyua report \\
    --results-file=~/.kyua/results/kyua.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
