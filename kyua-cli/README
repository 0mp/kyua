Kyua is a testing framework for both developers and users.  Kyua differs
from other testing frameworks in that it implements a generic runtime
and reporting engine that is able to execute test programs regardless of
the language they are implemented in or the unit-testing libraries that
they use.  Additionally, Kyua puts the user experience before anything
else by allowing end users (not only developers) to run the tests
themselves.

This module, kyua-cli, provides the command-line interface to the Kyua
runtime system.  The major purpose of this tool is to run test cases and
generate unified reports for their results.
