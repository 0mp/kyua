.Sh NAME
.Nm kyua-tap-tester
.Nd Scriptable interface to interact with TAP-compliant test programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar generic_flags
.Ar subcommand
.Op Ar subcommand_flags
.Op Ar subcommand_args
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a scriptable interface to interact with test programs that comply with
the Test Anything Protocol.  This manual page describes the specific features
that apply to this specific tester.  For the generic manual page, which
describes the command-line interface in detail, please see
.Xr kyua-tester 1 .
.Pp
TAP-compliant test programs are able to contain various independent test cases
and can report results information for each of them independently.  However,
such test programs are not designed to expose this structure upfront and, from
Kyua's point of view, they are made up of a single test case.  This has
implications in the way the tester interacts with the test program, as described
below.
.Ss Test cases list
Because TAP-compliant test programs have no ability to describe their internal
structure without actually running the tests,
.Nm
will always report a single test case as the output of
.Sq list .
This is normal and expected.
.Ss Execution
Because TAP-compliant test programs have no ability to describe their internal
structure without actually running the tests,
.Nm
will always run all tests within the test program in a single process space.
Internal failures in the test program that make it abort may cause the rest of
the test program to fail.
